# Bindings

This directory contains bindings for different languages. These bindings
allows easier communication with the __pvdd__ daemon.

The C binding is not part of this directory though (it is part of the src
directory for now).

Bindings for the following languages are provided :

* javascript (__js__ file)
* lua
* python 3

Note that use of these bindings is not mandatory since the public communication
protocol with the daemon is also made available.
